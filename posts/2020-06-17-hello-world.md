Hello World!! and welcome to Code with Beer my personal blog, by the way, who am I? I'm nobody in special, I'm just an ordinary developer who thinks that write a blog is the best way to help others and himself. but let' me introduce myself.



My name is Ronaldo Santiago, and I'm a developer, just it. I mean, we always have to work with everything, frontend, backend, mobile..., but currently, I'm enjoying to work with Frontend technologies, and like anyone other developers, I someone who loves stay hours in front of a computer writing several lines of code and believes me I been doing this professionally for a long time, since 2008.



During this eternity as a developer, I've had the opportunity to work in different contexts (Games, Web, Mobile) and programming languages. The technology is always in constant change and sometimes you feel that you need to share your ideas, thoughts, sometimes a random thing. So I decided to start to write a blog. I don't know if you have noticed but, this is the first post ^^



Why I blog instead of a medium article or LinkedIn post? the answer is pretty simple, I'm a developer, my life is coding something, and also, I already have the necessary skills, so why not build everything by myself? There is another point to take into consideration when you build/coding a blog by yourself, you are responsible for the identity. My point is: you are free to do everything, your layout, components, plugins, with your favorite programming language, every single step is a great opportunity for learning something new. I want to create an environment that you feel so comfortable like in a Pub with no worries, talking about, the life, the universe, and everything without pressure.



In general, when you try to find some material to study, it always is too formal with a lot of technical sentences that create more confusion than clarity at that particular moment. My intention here is the opposite, be the most softer than is possible, explaining using analogies that anyone is capable to understand, bringing subjects to all levels since a beginner to something to help an advance developer



About the content, well, I will try to talk about a lot of things, probably I going to start with my current work context (Frontend with React), my favorite development setup with Vim + Tmux (Vim, that terminal text editor), and then we will evolve to others languages, frameworks, I have some ideas to help the beginners too, so a lot of things.



I believe that I have written a lot to an intro, I promise that the next post will be more exciting. Please, have a seat and enjoy the blog. Code without moderation. If you drink, don't drive or deploy to production. ^^
