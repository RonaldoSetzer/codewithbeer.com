# Hello World!!!

Hello World!! and welcome to Code with Beer my brand new blog, by the way, who am I? I'm nobody special, just an ordinary software engineer who wants an excuse to write. but let' me introduce myself

[my cartoon with beer]

My name is Ronaldo Santiago, just someone who loves to stay hours in front of a computer like anyone else, writing several lines of code, killing bugs creating some bugs ^^, sometimes playing some games, sometimes coding some games, and believes me I've been doing this professionally for a long time.

During an eternity as a developer, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of programming languages in different contexts/platforms such as web(frontend, backend), mobile, games, and sometimes you feel that you can do more, share ideas, thoughts, projects, the evolution of a hobby, or just write about random things. So I decided to start to write a blog. I don't know if you have noticed but, this is the first post.

Why blog instead of an average article or a LinkedIn post? The answer is quite simple, I'm a developer and we are always trying to find an opportunity to code something to yourself, I already have the necessary skills to do it, so why not? Besides, in a blog, you are free, your ideas, layout, components, plugins, you can use your favorite programming language, each step is an excellent opportunity to learn something new.

About the content, well, I don't want to be too technical, writing long posts with a lot fancy/technical word that only experient developers understand and which sometimes creates more confusion than clarity, my intention here is totally the opposite, it is being softer than is possible with analogies that anyone will be capable to understand (I'm not sure if I'm capable to do this but of course I'm going to try).

I like to learn things, a new stack, framework, paradigm, frontend, backend, mobile, and also I've become a Vim (ide / terminal text editor) evangelist, so, we have a lot of subjects to talk about. Another thing that probably I will share here in the future is about my experience as a mentor, how I'm been to helping people who have decided to switch careers and want to become a developer, in other words, a total beginner. I will show their progress, frustrations, achievements, how I've been guiding them without losing my sanity.

Considering an intro post, I'm impressed, I have written more than I expect, but don't worry, I promise that into the next post the content will be more interesting. Please, have a seat, and enjoy the blog. Code without moderation. If you drink, don't drive or deploy to production. Wish me luck!
^^
