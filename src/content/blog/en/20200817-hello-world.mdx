Hello World!! and welcome to Code with Beer, My name is Ronaldo Santiago, just an ordinary software engineer ho loves spending hours in front of a computer writing lines of code, fixing bugs (and sometimes creating them ^^), playing games, and occasionally even coding some. Like many others out there. This is me, so welcome to my blog!

```javascript

const me = {
  name: "Ronaldo",
  lastName: "Santiago",
  nationality: "Brazilian",
  address: {
    country: "Brazil",
    city: "Rio de Janeiro",
  },
};
```

## Why “Code with Beer”?

Because some of the best ideas (and bugs) are born during those moments when you’re relaxed, sipping a cold beer, and staring at the terminal like it’s a puzzle to be solved.
It’s not really about drinking - it’s about enjoying the process, celebrating small wins, and embracing the chaos of coding.

One random day, while drinking a beer and seizing the triumph of a long session spent reconfiguring my Vim (a terminal-based text editor === my current IDE), I had an uncontrollable urge to share my experiences. How I built my Vim setup, which plugins I use, the keymaps I’ve created... and suddenly, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. That little spark started to burn and answered a question no one asked:

> *I should start writing about this. I’m going to create a tech blog.*

## Why create a blog instead of writing on Medium or LinkedIn?

The answer is quite simple. I’m a developer who loves to code and is always looking for an excuse to start a new project, explore new ideas, or learn something fresh. So why not build something of my own?

I already have the necessary skills to do it. Besides, in a blog, you are free to experiment with architecture, layout, and features. (Hope you liked it. I’m not a designer, btw ^^)

## What’s the reason behind this urge to write?

Back in the early days of my career (a long, long time ago, 2007), I had a blog. It was like my lab, a place where I’d share everything I was learning about game development at the time. That experience was powerful. I noticed I was retaining more knowledge and improving my skills faster. Writing helped me teach, and by teaching, I was learning even more.

Writing is like magic - it improves both soft and hard skills. Think about it: you don’t want to write nonsense, so you dive deep into topics until you feel confident. At the same time, you’re improving your writing and communication. Everyone wins.

## So… what’s this blog about?

Honestly? I don’t know yet. I’m not chasing consistency, I’m chasing excitement. Whenever I discover something cool, hit a breakthrough, or just want to vent about a tech frustration — you’ll find it here.

For an intro post, I wrote more than I expected. But this is just the beginning. I promise the next one will be even more interesting.

So grab a beer, take a seat, and enjoy the ride.
