Hello World!! and welcome to Code with Beer, My name is Ronaldo Santiago, just an ordinary software engineer who loves to stay hours in front of a computer, writing several lines of code, killing bugs, creating bugs, sometimes playing games, sometimes coding some games, like anyone else. This is me, so welcome to my blog.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World !!!");

const me = {
  name: "Ronaldo",
  lastName: "Santiago",
  nationality: "Brazilian",
  address: {
    country: "Brazil",
    city: "Rio de Janeiro",
  },
};
```

On a random day, when I was drinking a beer and seizing the triumph moment after spending the whole day reconfiguring my Vim (terminal text editor / my current IDE) I had the uncontrollable desire to share my experiences, how I had created my Vim setup, which plugins I have installed, which the keymaps I have, and all of sudden, I couldn't control my mind, that little spark started to burn and the answer to the question no one asked me rises.

> *I should start to write about it. I'm going to create a tech blog.*

**Why create a blog instead of using a popular platform such as Medium or LinkedIn?**

The answer is quite simple. I'm a developer, a developer who likes coding and is always trying to find an excuse to create a new project or product, an opportunity to learning something new, to use a popular framework, to leave the comfort zone. So why not? I already have the necessary skills to do it. Besides, in a blog, you are free to develop your ideas, from the content to architecture and layout (I hope you liked, I'm not a designer ^^).

**What the reason behind the necessity to write?**

In the beginning of my career (a long long time ago, 2007) I had a blog, a laboratory, a place which I used to teach things that I was learning in that period (game development), the experience was amazing and then I realized that I was retaining more knowledge than usual, improving my skills at each blog post, in other words, I was not only learning fast but also helping others to learn.

The act of writing is magic and allow us to improve our soft and hard skills. Think about it, you don't want to make mistakes so you will dive into the subject until you feel good enough to teach and, at the same time, you are improving your written and communication skills, everyone wins.

**how about the content of this blog?**

I guess something about technology. I mean, It's a little bit obvious, I'm a dev, probably I willseize the place to fulfill my necessity to share ideas, projects, the evolution of a hobby, or just write about random things. A curious thing is that when I'm learning something I feel so excited that my first thought is to share everything.

To an intro post, I'm impressed, I wrote more than I expect, of course, it was just the beginning, I promise that the next post the content is gonna be more interesting. Please, have a seat and enjoy the blog. Code without moderation. If you drink, don't drive or deploy to production. Wish me luck! ^^
