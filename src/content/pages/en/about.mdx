Let me guessâ€”youâ€™re expecting an epic career tale, full of legendary bug fixes and perfectly balanced sanity amid endless compile errors. Well, truth isâ€¦ I have no idea what Iâ€™m writing right now.

Iâ€™m just a software developer who loves writing code, fixing bugs, and helping teams build awesome products.

With more than 15 years of experience across web, mobile, and games, Iâ€™ve seen frameworks rise and fall, paradigms shift, and tech stacks evolve. I stay open to new technologies, currently working with Frontend (React) and Microservices (Node), while keeping an eye on Go as it keeps grabbing my attention.

ðŸ’¡ What excites me:
 â€¢ Frontend: Architecture, Foundation, React, Canvas (PixiJS)
 â€¢ Backend: Go (still a newbie, but eager to dive deeper)
 â€¢ Leadership: Mentoring & Tech Management

Deep expertise in Frontend Architecture, including Component Design, State Management, Micro-Frontends, Performance Optimization, and UI/UX best practices. Strong foundation in Software Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, Design Patterns, and scalable system design.

ðŸ’¬ Fluent in English (C1), currently self-learning German (B1).
ðŸš€ Open to new challenges: sharing knowledge through mentorship and tech talks, shaping scalable frontends and architecture, or just grabbing a coffee (or beer) to talk about technology, the universe, and everything else (42, right?).
